## Features

- **Intuitive Drum Pad Interface:** The project offers a simple drum pad interface where users can trigger drum sounds by tapping on virtual pads. Each pad corresponds to a specific percussion element, such as kick, snare, hi-hat, and cymbals.

- **Basic Drum Sound Library:** BeatMaker Mini comes with a selection of high-quality, pre-loaded drum sounds that cover essential elements needed to create various beat patterns. These sounds are carefully curated to provide versatility and inspire creativity.

- **Real-time Beat Composition:** Users can compose beats in real-time by tapping on the drum pads. The sounds are instantly triggered, allowing users to experiment, refine, and fine-tune their beats on the fly.

- **Tempo and Timing Control:** Adjust the tempo and timing controls to set the speed and rhythm of your beats. Explore different tempos to create energetic and dynamic beats or slow it down for more laid-back grooves.

- **Play and Loop Features:** Play your beats in a continuous loop, enabling you to build layers and experiment with different sound combinations. This feature helps in refining your beats and creating complex compositions.

- **Export and Share:** Export your created beats as audio files, which can be saved locally or shared with others. This functionality facilitates collaboration with fellow musicians or integration with digital audio workstations (DAWs) for further music production.
